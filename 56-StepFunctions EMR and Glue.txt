# In order for this lab to work correctly, you should run the EMR Applications lab first.
# The EMR Applications lab adds the NYC Taxi metadata to your Glue Data Catalog so you'll see the data when
# you use the Hue UI to run the queries.
# Also, make sure to run both the EMR Applications lab and this lab in the same AWS region.
