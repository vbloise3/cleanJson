      "question": "You are a machine learning specialist working for an oil refinery company. Your team is working on a machine learning problem where you need to determine the relationship between oil well depth and oil well production. In order to select the appropriate machine learning algorithm to use to attempt to solve the oil well production problem, you need to gain a better understanding of your data. For example, what is the correlation between your oil well depth data and your oil well production data? When you examine your data visually using the python matplotlib library, you find that your data has what looks like a non-Gaussian distribution of oil well depth and oil well production: graph showing hump shaped scatter plot data. Which correlation coefficient would you use to best summarize the strength of the correlation between your oil well depth and oil well production?",
