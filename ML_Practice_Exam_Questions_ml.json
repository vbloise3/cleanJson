      "question": "Amazon API Gateway is being used by an organization to give a public API named Survey for gathering user feedback on its goods. The survey API is divided into phases called DEV and PROD and consists of a single resource called feedback that enables users to retrieve/create/update individual feedback postings.A Swagger file with version control is used to describe a new API for retrieving numerous feedback postings. To add the new API resource ListFeedbackForProduct, the developer modifies the Swagger file that defines the API, uploads the file to the organizations version control system, and uses the API Gateways Import API function to update the Survey API. Following successful import, the developer performs tests against the DEV stage and discovers that the resource ListFeedbackForProduct is missing. What is the MOST LIKELY explanation for the resources non-availability?",
